# Sprite Kit Collisions Playground

This playground demonstrates how do physics perform collision detection using
Swift and Sprite Kit.

This playground was written using Swift 2 and Xcode 7. It covers creating
category bit masks and contact delegates to detect colliding physics bodies
during runtime.
